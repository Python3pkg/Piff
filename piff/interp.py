    In general, the interpolator is agnostic as to the meaning of the parameter vectors.
    These parameter vectors are passed as simple numpy arrays.  They are imbued meaning by
    a Model instance.  Thus, the same interpolators may be used with many different Model
    types.

    The principal ways that interpolators will differ are

    1. Which properties of the star are used for ther interpolation
    2. What functional form (or algorithm) is used to interpolate between measurements.
    3. Whether the interpolator assumes each sample has a non-degenerate parameter fit, vs
       getting a differential quadratic form for chisq from each sample.

    This answer to #3 is given in a boolean property degenerate_points.
